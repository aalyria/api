## create

Create one or more entities described in textproto files.

Updates, or creates if missing, one or more entities described in textproto files.

**--files, -f**="": [REQUIRED] Glob of textproto files that represent one or more Entity messages.

**--ignore_consistency_check**: Always update or create the entity, without verifying that the provided `commit_timestamp` matches the currently stored entity.

## list

Lists all entities of a given type.

**--field_masks**="": Comma-separated allow-list of fields to include in the response; see the aalyria.spacetime.api.nbi.v1alpha.EntityFilter.field_masks documentation for usage details.

## delete

Deletes one or more entities. Provide the type and ID to delete a single entity, or a directory of Entity textproto files to delete multiple entities.

**--files, -f**="": Glob of textproto files that represent one or more Entity messages.

**--id**="": ID of entity to delete.

**--ignore_consistency_check**: Always update or create the entity, without verifying that the provided `commit_timestamp` matches the value in the currently stored entity.

**--last_commit_timestamp**="": Delete the entity only if `last_commit_timestamp` matches the `commit_timestamp` of the currently stored entity. (default: 0)

**--type, -t**="": Type of entity to delete. Allowed values: [ANTENNA_PATTERN, BAND_PROFILE, COMPUTED_MOTION, DEVICES_IN_REGION, INTENT, INTERFACE_LINK_REPORT, INTERFERENCE_CONSTRAINT, NETWORK_NODE, NETWORK_STATS_REPORT, PLATFORM_DEFINITION, SERVICE_REQUEST, STATION_SET, SURFACE_REGION, TRANSCEIVER_LINK_REPORT]

## get-link-budget

Gets link budget details

**--analysis_end_timestamp**="": An RFC3339 formatted timestamp for the end of the interval to evaluate the signal propagation. If unset, the signal propagation is evaluated at the instant of the `analysis_start_timestamp.`

**--analysis_start_timestamp**="": An RFC3339 formatted timestamp for the beginning of the interval to evaluate the signal propagation. Defaults to the current local timestamp.

**--band_profile_id**="": The Entity ID of the BandProfile used for this link.

**--explain_inaccessibility**: If true, the server will spend additional computational time determining the specific set of access constraints that were not satisfied and including these reasons in the response.

**--input_file**="": A path to a textproto file containing a SignalPropagationRequest message. If set, it will be used as the request to the SignalPropagation service. If unset, the request will be built from the other flags.

**--output_file**="": Path to a textproto file to write the response. If unset, defaults to stdout. (default: /dev/stdout)

**--reference_data_timestamp**="": An RFC3339 formatted timestamp for the instant at which to reference the versions of the platforms. Defaults to `analysis_start_timestamp`. (default: analysis_start_timestamp)

**--spatial_propagation_step_size**="": The analysis step size for spatial propagation metrics. (default: 1m)

**--step_size**="": The analysis step size and the temporal resolution of the response. (default: 1m)

**--target_platform_id**="": The Entity ID of the PlatformDefinition that represents the target. Leave unset if the antenna is fixed or non-steerable, in which case coverage calculations will be returned.

**--target_transceiver_model_id**="": The ID of the transceiver model on the target.Leave unset if the antenna is fixed or non-steerable, in which case coverage calculations will be returned.

**--tx_platform_id**="": The Entity ID of the PlatformDefinition that represents the transmitter.

**--tx_transceiver_model_id**="": The ID of the transceiver model on the transmitter.

## generate-keys

Generate RSA keys to use for authentication with the Spacetime APIs.

>After creating the Private-Public keypair, you will need to request API access by sharing the `.crt` file (a self-signed x509 certificate containing the public key) with Aalyria to receive the `USER_ID` and a `KEY_ID` needed to complete the nbictl configuration. Only share the public certificate (`.crt`) with Aalyria or third-parties. The private key (`.key`) must be protected and should never be sent by email or communicated to others.

**--country**="": Country of certificate.

**--dir, --directory**="": Directory to store the generated RSA keys in. (default: ~/.config/nbictl/keys)

**--location**="": Location of certificate.

**--org, --organization**="": [REQUIRED] Organization of certificate.

**--state**="": State of certificate.

## list-configs

List all configuration profiles (ignores any `--context` flag)

## get-config

Prints the NBI connection settings associated with the configuration profile given by the `--context` flag (defaults to "DEFAULT").

## set-config

Sets or updates a configuration profile that contains NBI connection settings. You can create multiple configs by specifying the name of the configuration using the `--context` flag (defaults to "DEFAULT").

**--key_id**="": Key ID associated with the private key provided by Aalyria.

**--priv_key**="": Path to the private key to use for authentication.

**--transport_security**="": Transport security to use when connecting to the NBI service. Allowed values: [insecure, system_cert_pool]

**--url**="": NBI endpoint specified as `host[:port]` (port is optional and defaults to 443).

**--user_id**="": User ID associated with the private key provided by Aalyria.
