# Contributions

This is an open-source directory of real hardware that has been modeled in Spacetime and used in real networks. Contributions to this directory are welcome and are governed by the same policies as stated in the repository's [governance document](../GOVERNANCE.md). 

For example:
- [loon/antenna_pattern.textproto](loon/antenna_pattern.textproto): An antenna pattern specified using phi, theta, and gain, with separate patterns for near- and far- field. This pattern models the millimeter-wave antennas used by Loon's balloons for gateway and inter-platform links.
