# Governance

Spacetime’s APIs are under active development by the internal developer team. Contributions from the wider developer community will be considered according to the guidelines in this document. 

## Contributing
To propose a change to the APIs, please first email the Maintainers at spacetime-maintainers@aalyria.com to discuss the change. 

Major changes to the API, such as fundamental re-architectures, will require additional discussion and will proceed once the Spacetime Maintainers have aligned.

Minor changes to the API, such as non-breaking changes that do not affect core functionality, should be discussed over email as well, but will proceed without a major design discussion.
