// The BandProfile is the abstraction by which Spacetime predicts the modulation
// and coding scheme (MODCOD) that would be selected by the adaptive or fixed 
// coding and modulation. This abstraction allows Spacetime to determine whether
// a received signal meets the minimum strength or noise thresholds to close a 
// link, and if so, to estimate the capacity of the link based on the predicted
// MODCOD.
//
// As a performance optimization, Spacetime associates channels that can be 
// considered to have similar wireless propagation loss characteristics into
// a single BandProfile. Spacetime's wireless propagation analysis 
// can then be executed once per BandProfile, as opposed to once per channel.   
//
// To illustrate this concept, consider the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands in WiFi. 
// There are many channels in the 2.4GHz band, such as channels 1 - 11, and 
// there are many channels in the 5GHz band, such as channels 36, 40, 48, etc. 
// In many cases, the channels in the 2.4GHz band can be considered to have the
// same propagation loss effects, and the channels in the 5GHz band can be 
// considered to have the same propagation loss effects. But, a channel in the 
// 2.4GHz band *cannot* be considered to have the same propagation loss effects 
// as a channel in the 5GHz band. So, these bands could be modeled as 2 
// BandProfiles, one for the 2.4GHz band and one for the 5GHz band, and the 
// propagation loss would be computed once for each BandProfile. 
// 
// A separate BandProfile should be created for each set of channels that 
// shares: 
//  1) The same allocated bandwidth
//  2) The same Adaptive Coding and Modulation configuration
