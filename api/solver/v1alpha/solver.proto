// This file defines the SolutionIngester service, which allows clients to solve
// the allocation of system and radio resources within the network instead of 
// Spacetime's native solving engine.
//
// Clients should use the Spacetime Model API RPCs to fetch the state of the
// network, and the Provisioning API RPCs for the network requests needing to
// be solved.
// TODO: Add a tailored RPC to this service to allow clients to stream 
// the state of the network and requests. 
// 
// Clients are expected to analyze the wireless signal propagation from the
// devices in the network and accordingly, compute an allocation of system 
// resources (e.g. assigning satellites to ground stations, user terminals to 
// satellites, ISL resources, transmit power levels) and radio resources (e.g.
// assigning carriers to links, beam hopping plans). The RPCs in the 
// SolutionIngester service allow clients to send these allocations to
// Spacetime, and in turn, Spacetime will distribute messages to each network
// element across the Southbound interface in order to configure the resources
// in the network.
//
// Solvers may want to use up-to-date network telemetry reported by each
// network element as an input.
// TODO: Add an RPC to allow clients to retrieve telemetry from netowrk
// elements.
//
// Spacetime uses INTENT entities to describe intended changes to the network,
// so each resource allocation is defined by an INTENT entity.
// TODO: Add an RPC to alloc clients to retrieve the current or previous
// system and radio resource allocation decisions.
